## What is the TUIC Protocol?

The TUIC protocol is a network protocol written in the Rust programming language. Rust is a very fast and secure programming language comparable to C, making the TUIC protocol equally safe and stable.

* TUIC is built on top of the QUIC protocol
* TUIC consumes fewer resources, runs efficiently, and is suitable for large-scale projects such as games
* TUIC is highly secure, ideal for transmitting sensitive data
* TUIC is difficult to detect
* TUIC is suitable for scenarios like bypassing internet censorship, live video streaming, game acceleration, and voice calls
