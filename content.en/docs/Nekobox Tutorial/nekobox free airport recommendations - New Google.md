## How to Choose an Airport (Proxy Service Provider)

We habitually refer to organizations that provide proxy services as “airports,” implying they allow you to “fly” to different parts of the world and enjoy freer internet access—similar to a [VPN](https://getfreevpn.info/zh). However, since this industry is a special niche and not welcomed by certain authorities in China, being an airport operator is a high-risk job—one wrong move can land you in trouble. Likewise, most airports are not particularly stable and may suddenly stop working, resulting in unrecoverable funds. This is common.

So, although airports are convenient and useful for users in China, it's important to choose wisely. You can either use free services to avoid loss, or stick with long-standing, reputable providers that have been around for a while.
