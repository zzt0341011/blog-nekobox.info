## Tutorial on Purchasing and Using Nodes

- The software only works after importing VPN nodes.  
- A node is a server on the internet that can be used with nekobox to access the web.  
- This allows access to the international internet.  
- Independent nodes are the most stable since they are not affected by external factors, making them more reliable and less likely to be blocked.  
- This provider has 23 nodes across about 10 countries with very fast speed. [Click to register](https://www.nfsq.us/#/register?code=i1fXTMYk)
